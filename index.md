Here I plan to have code that I've written for machine learning practice as well as content for various math courses I teach. 

Stay tuned!

# Welcome

I'm attempting to collect some of my interests in one place here. This will include some machine learning practice (and coding practice, for that matter) that I've been undertaking, as well as notes from the math courses I teach and some of the research that I've been involved with. It will also serve as a host for some of my GitHub resources. For example, my [MAT473, Rings and Modules](https://github.com/antcarro/MAT473), materials are at the preceding link.
